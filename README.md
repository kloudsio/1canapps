# 1canapps
Dear 12 factor freaks:  Stay away!  These apps are in just one can, and via a teeny bit of magic, only have one volume per application which exposes config and database!  Here you can find shell scripts for launching them, as well as the Dockerfiles.  There's no need for Docker-compose, because you get the whole app in just one can!  


Yum.
